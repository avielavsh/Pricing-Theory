# Project: Delta and Gamma Hedging for European Call Options

## Overview
This project analyzes **European call options**, focusing on **Delta and Gamma hedging** techniques. It implements Monte Carlo simulations to estimate option sensitivities and evaluate risk management strategies under different market conditions.

## Features
- **Delta and Gamma Hedging Analysis:** Evaluates hedging effectiveness using derivatives.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Models underlying asset price dynamics.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Measures Delta and Gamma changes in response to market movements.
- **Risk Management Strategies:** Examines hedging performance in various scenarios.

## Methodology
1. **Define Model Parameters:**
   - Establish financial variables for European call option pricing.
   
2. **Compute Delta and Gamma Sensitivities:**
   - Evaluate how option prices change with respect to the underlying asset.
   
3. **Simulate Asset Price Movements:**
   - Use Monte Carlo methods to model price paths.
   
4. **Implement Delta and Gamma Hedging Strategies:**
   - Assess risk mitigation effectiveness.
   
5. **Analyze Performance Under Market Fluctuations:**
   - Compare hedging efficiency under different volatility scenarios.

## Results
- Provides insights into Delta and Gamma behavior for European call options.
- Demonstrates effectiveness of hedging strategies.
- Visualizes option price sensitivity and risk management performance.

## Dependencies
- Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- Jupyter Notebook for executing simulations and analysis.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to:
- Define model parameters.
