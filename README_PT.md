# Project: American Put Option Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on pricing **American put options** using Monte Carlo simulations and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). It models asset price paths, determines optimal early exercise boundaries, and analyzes pricing strategies under different market conditions.

## Features
- **Parameter Definition:** Establishes key financial variables for option pricing.
- **Early Exercise Boundary Computation:** Identifies optimal points for early exercise of American put options.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Models asset price movements using GBM to estimate option value.
- **Sample Path Analysis:** Generates and visualizes simulated price paths and decision points.

## Methodology
1. **Define Model Parameters:**
   - Establish key variables for American put option pricing.
   
2. **Calculate Early Exercise Boundaries:**
   - Identify price levels at which early exercise is optimal.
   
3. **Simulate Asset Price Paths:**
   - Use Monte Carlo methods and GBM to model price movements.
   
4. **Estimate Option Value:**
   - Implement Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) for pricing American-style options.
   
5. **Analyze Pricing Strategies:**
   - Evaluate the effect of early exercise on option valuation.

## Results
- Provides insights into optimal exercise strategies for American put options.
- Visualizes sample paths and early exercise decision points.
- Assesses pricing sensitivity to various market conditions.

## Dependencies
- Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- Jupyter Notebook for running and visualizing simulations.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to:
- Define financial parameters.
- Simulate asset price movements using Monte Carlo methods.
- Compute early exercise boundaries and analyze option pricing strategies.
